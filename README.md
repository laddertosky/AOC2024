# AOC2024
My journey to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).
This is my first time to join this event.
I leverage this problem set to learn new programming language (Golang, BTW).

Most of the answer can only be solved by optimized algorithms, which makes it challenging and cool.
The two most tricky quesions are day14 and day24 for me, which took me longer than expected.
